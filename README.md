## Currently Learning

> I believe in investing into what and where it truly matters. Here’s what I’m actively upskilling in to stay ahead and build AI solutions that matter:

🔸 Maths for Data Science by Krish Naik (Udemy) - mastering the mathematical backbone of ML: linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics with practical intuition.
🔸 Python Data Structures & Algorithms by Krish Naik (Udemy) - strengthening coding fundamentals and logical problem-solving to write optimized, production-ready data workflows.
🔸 Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (Coursera) - mastering supervised, unsupervised, and advanced ML techniques with hands-on projects in model tuning, feature engineering, and deployment.

> My goal is to bridge tech with business — building tools that not only work but **deliver value**.
